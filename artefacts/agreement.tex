\section*{Background}
The following team working agreement was formulated and agreed upon
at a team meeting on the 29th of January 2020. Each member of the team
were permitted to add items to be considered, and a unanimous decision
was required before any items were accepted.

Furthermore, it was agreed that, once accepted, all items must be followed
by the team and failure to do so would result in disciplinary action being
taken.
