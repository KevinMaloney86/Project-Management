\section*{Review}
At the conclusion of Starship Trooper's first sprint, the team
gathered for a retrospective meeting where the preceding two weeks
were discussed, analysed and evaluated.

The product owner was extremely impressed with the end-of-sprint
technical demo. In fact, the product owner was so impressed with the
demo he took an early version of \texttt{oubliette} home with him
over the weekend and clocked up over 4 hours of playtime. He was
especially impressed with the ``zombie nutria'' enemy that was added
by our developer Eoin Lernihan.

Having completed all of our user stories allocated for the first
sprint, the team identified that our estimated team velocity was
exceptionally accurate. The team's developers.

The feedback from the team, collected anonymously, is outlined
below:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scrum master was good at motivating team
\item Product owner was demanding
\item Difficult to get game ported to Windows
\item Difficult to set up automated tests because lack of team
knowledge in this domain
\item Burn-down rate was as high as expected; good estimation
\end{itemize}

As a result of the meeting, the team agreed to add the following
improvement to the sprint backlog for the upcoming second sprint:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Research automated testing framework for C; consider using
\texttt{libepoxy}
\end{enumerate}
