\section*{Preamble}
The following burn down chart is a pre-sprint estimate for Starship
Trooper's \texttt{oubliette} project. It documents the expected
velocity for the team's first sprint and will provide an invaluable
benchmark for use in planning the velocity of the subsequent sprint.

The chart was produced using the \LaTeX\ typesetting language, and
the corresponding source file can be found in the Starship Trooper's
\texttt{git} repository.

\section*{Team velocity}
Due to our team's strong experience with the C programming language
and the advanced status of the proof-of-concept that was implemented
early in the planning process, we estimate our team velocity to be
c. 25 points per sprint.

While this may seem ambitious, we are confident that our team's ability
and the aid of Jira\textregistered--\textit{``the \#1 software development
tool used by agile teams''}--we can produce a shippible product by the
end of the first sprint.
